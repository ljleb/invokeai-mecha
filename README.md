# Merge Nodes

**Note: the merge node is not yet all functional, as the node interface for registering new models is not yet available in invokeai.**

This repo provides InvokeAI nodes for model merging with [sd-mecha](https://github.com/ljleb/sd-mecha).

## Install

To install the merge nodes, simply clone this repository to your InvokeAI nodes directory:

```commandline
git clone https://github.com/ljleb/invokeai-mecha.git
```

By default, if no version of sd-mecha is found, the latest one is installed.
